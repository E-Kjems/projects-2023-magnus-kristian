# Model analysis project

**By:** Magnus, Kristian and Kristian

Our project is titled **Cournot model** and is about the strategic interaction of N heterogenous firms that produce heterogenous goods.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) which draws on functions in modelproject.py.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
